API Gateway Microservice
-----------------------
Entry point for the API Gateway & Ingestion Service. Sets up FastAPI app, routers, and middleware.

Routers:
    - auth: Authentication endpoints
    - users: User management endpoints
    - v1: Versioned API endpoints (including ingestion)
    - redis_router: Redis health and pub/sub endpoints

Middleware:
    - InMemoryRateLimiter: Local rate limiting (bypassed during tests)

App State:
    - ingestion_manager: Instance of IngestionViewsManager for job and asset management

Health Endpoint:
    - GET /health: Returns service status
